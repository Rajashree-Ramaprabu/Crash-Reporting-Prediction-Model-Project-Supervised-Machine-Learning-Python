Developed an advanced supervised machine learning models with the goal of predicting the severity of driver injuries and the extent of vehicle damage following collisions sing classification algorithms Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest. Employed a comprehensive analysis of various input variables, including collision type, weather conditions, and traffic density, performed hyperparameter tuning and feature selection using Python to achieve 99% accuracy on the prediction result to craft predictive models offering crucial insights into road safety and accident preventiod. Modified the approach to road safety by creating models that accurately assess the combined impact of multiple factors on collision outcomes. These models possess the potential to significantly advance our understanding of road incident dynamics and guide targeted interventions by stakeholders such as law enforcement agencies and policymakers. Created a PowerPoint presentation along with multiple data graphs to showcase the insights generated using the prediction model and have also highlighted future recommendations and potential explorations of the project.
